- `üêç main_window.py`: It initializes the main window and sets up the user interface.
- `üêç toolbar.py`: Contains the implementation of the toolbar widget, including actions for various functionality like new plot, add subplot, save image, etc.
- `üêç function_plotter.py`: Defines the function plotter widget that allows users to input mathematical functions and set the range of the x-axis.
- `üêç widgets_actions.py`: Implements the actions performed by the widgets, such as plotting a function, saving images, zooming in/out, etc.
- `üìÇ Tests/`: 
  - `üêç test_plotting_actions.py`:   Contains test cases for the plot, add_subplot, and new_plot functions

## Dependencies

- `PySide2`: The PySide2 library is used to create the GUI components of the application.
- `Matplotlib`: Matplotlib is used for generating the plots and customizing their appearance.
- `pytest`: a popular testing tool for Python. The pytest library simplifies writing test cases, making assertions, and handling fixtures.
- `pytest-qt`: is a plugin for the pytest testing framework that provides additional capabilities for testing PyQt and PySide applications. It simplifies the process of testing GUI applications by offering various fixtures and helper functions

## Installation and Using

> 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
> 2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
>```
> pip install PySide2 matplotlib
> ```
> 3. Run the `main.py` file to start the application.


## Testing and Mocking

> üîπ The Function Plotter application uses the `pytest` testing framework to create unit tests for various components 
of the application. Additionally, it employs the `pytest-qt` plugin to facilitate GUI testing with PyQt or PySide. 
In some test cases, the application also utilizes the concept of mocking to isolate specific parts of the application for testing.
> 
> üîπ Unit testing is a crucial part of the Function Plotter project to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of its functionality. The application's core features and actions are covered by unit tests, 
which verify the behavior of individual components in isolation.


### Test Framework and Dependencies

> üîπ The unit tests are written using the `pytest` framework, a popular testing tool for Python. The `pytest` 
> library simplifies writing test cases, making assertions, and handling fixtures.
> 
> üîπ Also using `pytest-qt`, a plugin for the pytest testing framework that provides additional
capabilities for testing PyQt and PySide applications. 
It simplifies the process of testing GUI applications by offering various fixtures and helper functions.

### Pytest Fixtures and QtBot

> The application uses the `pytest-qt` plugin to create a `qtbot` fixture that allows programmatic 
> interaction with the GUI. The `qtbot` fixture is used to simulate user interactions like button clicks,
> text inputs, and other widget interactions during the test cases. By using `qtbot`, we can verify that GUI components 
> behave as expected when subjected to various user actions.

### Mocking with Mocker

> To isolate specific functionalities and dependencies during testing, the application uses the `pytest-mock` 
library to create mock objects. Mocking allows us to replace real objects or functions with custom mock implementations 
that simulate the behavior of the real objects without executing the actual code. By doing so, we can control the responses 
of mocked functions and focus on testing specific parts of the application in isolation.

To run the unit tests, make sure you have installed the required dependencies by running:

```
pip install pytest pytest-qt
```

### Running the Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, execute the following command from the project's root directory:

```
pytest
```
